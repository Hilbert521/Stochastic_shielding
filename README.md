## Fast and Accurate Langevin Simulations of Stochas-tic Hodgkin-Huxley Dynamics
1. Figure 1 (HH diagram) is generated by the tex code
2. Figure 2 (4D and 14D HH models) can be generated from codes in folder "Figure2", it takes roughly 5 minutes to run the script Fig2.m
3. Figure 3 (convergence to the multinomial submanifold) can be generated by codes in folder "Figure3", it takes roughly 5 minutes to run the script Fig3.m
4. Figure 4 (Edge importance under voltage clamp) is reproduced with permission from Figs. 10 & 13 of [Schmidt and Thmas (2014) paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24742077/)
5. Figure 5 (edge importance under current clamp) can be reproduced from codes in folder "Figure5". 
Several figures has a separate file to generate the plot (Figure 2, 3, 5 and 6), some are included in one file, namely, "All_models" (Table 3, Figure 7, 8 and 9).
